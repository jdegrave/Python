## Capstone Project: 
[Toggle API](https://github.com/jdegrave/Python/tree/master/Capstone_Project_TogglAPI)

This is my final project for an introductory Python class using Python 3.5.1. 

### Purpose
This project fetches workspace, project information, and client information from various Toggl APIs. It is a very basic/crude 
project management application. 

### Disclaimers 
1. APIs were not covered in class; researched on my own. 
2. There is a lot more functionality to add - for example, user information. 
3. Eventually this will become a basic project management web app.
4. In future releases, additional child classes will be created from the TogglWorkSpace class
