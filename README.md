# Python
This repository contains Python code from a Python course taken Winter Semester 2016:
## Homework
  - [Python Introduction](https://github.com/jdegrave/Python/tree/master/PythonIntroduction) - Exercises that came with Python. The HTML files provide an explanation for each exercise. These lessons had an automated testing to check results.

## Final / Capstone Project: [Toggle API](https://github.com/jdegrave/Python/tree/master/TogglAPI)
A bit more about the Final Project: 
This is my final project for an introductory Python class using Python 3.5.1. 

### Purpose
This project fetches workspace, project information, and client information from various Toggl APIs. It is a very basic/crude 
project management application. 

### Disclaimers 
1. APIs were not covered in class. I did my best to figure it out. 
2. There is a lot more functionality to add - for example, user information. 
3. Eventually this will become a basic project management web app.
4. In future releases, additional child classes will be created from the TogglWorkSpace class
