# Python Introduction

These are xercises that came with PyCharm. 
- Each lesson is divided into tasks. Task descriptions are included here for quick reference.
- Each task has an HTML file to provide an explanation for each exercise. 
- Each task had an automated testing to check results; therefore solutions had to match the programmed answer.
